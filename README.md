# Task Management API

This is the final project required to graduate from the ALX Backend Web Development course.

## Introduction

The Task Management API is a robust and scalable backend service designed to manage tasks efficiently. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks. This API is built with a focus on performance, security, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Create new tasks with various attributes such as title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Task Retrieval**: Retrieve tasks based on different criteria such as status, priority, and due date.
- **Task Update**: Update existing tasks to change their attributes.
- **Task Deletion**: Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **User Authentication**: Secure endpoints with user authentication and authorization.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handle large sets of tasks with pagination.

## System Design

The system design is documented in a `.drawio` file. You can view the detailed system architecture [here](path/to/system_design.drawio).

## Database Design

The database design is illustrated in the image below:
